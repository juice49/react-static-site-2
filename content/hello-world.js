    <h2>Loading Content</h2>
    <p>Loading content is remarkably easy thanks to webpack's implementation of
      the upcoming JavaScript `import()` functionâ€”a way to dynamically
      import modules.</p>
    <p>This can be run both on the server and the client, providing a
      universal way to fetch the component needed to render a page. And it
      seems to work really well... the only problem is, it doesn't.</p>
